Hello, my name is Marko LukiÄ‡.
While most of my professional work is in Python, I like to explore many other programming languages.
I'm also interested in various computer science topics:
- Artificial intelligence
- Optimization (function output min/maximization, but also performance optimization)
- Computation theory
- Algorithms and data structures
- Computer graphics
- Game design
